# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

This section will give a brief introduction to Pets' Caregiver, including the background of the project, the detailed functions of the systems, the main characteristics of the application, and simple research into similar products.

## 1.2 Project Purpose

With the continuous improvement of the quality of life, more and more people begin to keep a pet. As the latest White Paper on China's Pet Industry indicates, the market size of pets has reached 206.5 billion in 2020. However, thereâ€™s still no one app in the market that provides complete medical services for pet owners. Therefore, we want to design an app for pet owners so they can obtain integral services for their pets. In addition, those who don't own a pet can also get recommendations and see cute animals from the Pet Community.

However, the key usability goal of this app is to provide a full range of medical services for pets. This function is still very rare and of great value in the market.

## 1.3 System Functions

This system includes the following functions:

- Medical Services: we design to set *pet grooming* and *pet diagnosis* for medical purposes. In the latter part, we will provide multiple consulting methods, including self-examination on pets, online consultation with doctors, making an appointment for door-to-door services, and reservation for an offline clinic. We even plan to provide home delivery services for timely medicine supply.

- Pet Community: a platform for pet lovers to share their loving pets and experiences of raising them. Besides, considering the current situation that many universities have stray animals on the campus, we plan to set up an area, especially for them, where we will connect with relevant campus clubs, raise crowdfunding for stray animals, and offer adoption services.

- Health Mall: in the Health Mall, we will provide a list of recommended items for loving pets, like health products, deworming medicine, food, etc.

- Personalized Profile: In each account, we will provide a pet profile for its owner, through which the owner can get personalized notification about the character of his pet(e.g. health condition, the characteristics of the breed)

## 1.4 System Characteristics

- Door-to-door drug delivery services based on online consultation.

- Pet files construction to facilitate backtracking.

- A pet community as a communication platform.

- A crowdfunding platform for pet medical expenses.

- Cooperate with some universities' clubs to help build an aid platform for stray animals on campus.

- Build a user platform. Pet owners can set up files for their pets, according to which the platform will provide services like case analysis, regular reminders, and so on. 

## 1.5 Product Research

So far there is no such comprehensive app that specifies in pet-care on the market, but there are some similar products with imperfect functions, some of which is listed here:

- Pet Doctor (Shanghai PZP Network Technology Co., Ltd.): Provide online consultation for pet doctors, some basic knowledge related to pets, common parenting experience, etc.

- Pet Market (Shanghai Hongge Network Technology Co., Ltd.): Take pet secured transactions as the core, and extend other services like pet supplies, pet insurance, etc.

- Puppy At Home Pet Community (Puppy Home Information Technology Co., Ltd): Pet service community centered on pet foster care, beauty, and information sharing.

- Compared with the above pet service apps, our products are more targeted, and also realize the function of "medical treatment" very comprehensively. There are both beauty and diagnosis&treatment, both self-examination and consultation, both online and offline. Also, community service is provided for users to share tips for keeping pets, such as superior pet products and a caring experience. And you can buy relevant essential items for pet raising through the mall.



# 2 Use case modeling

## 2.1 Actor

The Actors in our product are mainly divided into four parts:

- **Administrator**. The Administrator has the highest power in the whole system, including user management, community governance, doctor certification, and so on.

- **Visitor**.The Visitor represents unregistered users in the system. They can view posts in the community, but can't interact in the community nor consult with doctors unless they register an account.

- **Registered User**

  This kind of user already has a legitimate account, and may has different categories as follows:

  - **Pet Doctor**: Certified doctors that are able to diagnose animals and make appointments.
  - **Store**: Sell goods and deal with feedback from customers.
  - **Pet Owner**: Registered accounts with a complete pet profile. They can seek help from veterinaries, as well as post in the community.
  - **Stray Animal Organization**: Users with a special authentication, representing that they are official organizations for stray animals. They have permission to post information about pets that can be adopted, and raise crowdfunding for homeless pets.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## 2.2 Agile Development and Requirement Analysis

- **User Persona**

To fully explore the functions of our application, we need to draw some user personas, which are archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. By attaining a deeper understanding of our audience, we can build a more exceptional and innovative product.

The pictures below describe some typical users.

<img src="images/John.png" alt="img" style="zoom: 50%;" />

<img src="images/Lisa.png" alt="img" style="zoom: 50%;" />

- User Stories
  -  One pet lover
    Once my pet gets sick, it is difficult for me to judge its symptoms and causes. There is little information about pet diseases on the Internet. It is also troublesome to go to the hospital for consultation. I really want a platform to help me when my pet is sick.
  - Another pet lover
    I often see stray animals in my city. Since nobody can distinguish them, we can't know when or where they need human help. Can there be any organizations helping us to manage those stray animals?
    I hope to provide a platform to help lost pets find their owners. Not long ago, I accidentally lost my dog while walking, and I haven't found it until now. It disturbed me a lot.
  - A pet doctor
    When I worked in the pet hospital, there aren't lots of pet owners visiting. Many pets cannot get effective treatment when they are ill for various reasons, such as convenience or price. I always think online consultation is a perfect alternative for offline treatment, because the owners can treat their pets by following the doctor's advice. All you need is to judge what kind of diseases the pet gets.
  - Campus pet club
    We often find injured pets on campus, but we lack relevant professionals to treat them. Even some experienced students find it difficult to determine the cause of pets. The evaluation of relevant pet products in the market is also deficient, so it is difficult for us to identify what is good.


- Enabler Stories
  - Provide a platform for pet owners to determine the diseases of pets. It should contain common pet diseases and their characteristics, as well as corresponding solutions.
  - Establish an online consultation system, where pet owners can consult pet doctors without visiting certain pet hospitals. Doctors can earn some medical expenses in this system.
  - Set up a special pet mall, which sells pet products only. And each customer can comment on the products for other buyers.
  - Give the public a platform to help stray pets find their owners where they upload the pets' photos and users can choose which pet to adopt.

If anything is wrong during this section, the order will be cancelled by the system. Then the store should deliver the goods to the User and if the User is not satisfied with the goods or even doesn't get it, the after-sale service will be started.
